Hi! I am Mallika, a final year BTech. in Computer Science undergraduate student at the [International Institue of Information Technology Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I am an inquisitive student and am always eager to explore new concepts in the realm of computer science. Deeply passionate about the field of Natural Language Processing and linguistics, I enjoy reading about exciting research in this domain.

I am an undergraduate research student at [Precog IIITH](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfzQyP8AAAAJ&hl=en). My work revolves around Social Computing and NLP for social good.

I have previously interned with Google and have also been a part of the Microsoft Engage 2020 program.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
