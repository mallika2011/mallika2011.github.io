Hi! I am Mallika! I'm an MSCS student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I'm currently a SWE intern at Apple, Seattle with the Block Storage team. 

I am actively looking for Full Time opportunities starting Jan 2024, please reach out if you thik I'd be a good fit for your team!

I am an inquisitive student and am always eager to explore new concepts in the realm of computer science. Deeply passionate about the field of Computational Social Science and Natural Language Processing, I enjoy reading about exciting research in this domain.

Previously, I received my undergraduate degree [B.Tech in Computer Science with Honours] at the [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). At IIIT Hyderabad, I was an undergraduate research student at [Precog IIITH](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfzQyP8AAAAJ&hl=en). My work revolved around Social Computing and NLP for Social Good.

<!-- I have previously interned with Google for two consecutive summers - 2020 and 2021. In both my Google stints I received hands on experience working with Google technologies and products, as well as contributing to their colossal codebase. I worked with the Google Maps team in 2020 and the Learning and Education - [Read Along](https://readalong.google/) team in 2021. I have also been a part of Microsoft's Mentorship program, Engage, in the year 2020. -->

<!-- I strongly believe in giving back, and am proactively involved in assisting my peers and juniors in inclusive tech-spaces. I served as one of the admins for the [Lean In IIIT-H](https://leanin.org/circles/iiit-hyderabad) chapter where I promoted an inclusive tech-culture enabling the women students community with access to resources and mentorship through outreach programs. -->

Apart from academics & technology, I invest a fair share of my time in following my creative interests. I'm a classically trained Bharatanatyam dancer and enjoy digital art!
