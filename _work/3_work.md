Worked with the GSeekh team forthe [Read Along](https://readalong.google/) android app. Built an end-to-end implementation of a new

Leveraged Google’s generative text [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/) language model specific to the app’s use case. Incorporated the Google Cloud APIs for Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech.
